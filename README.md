# Sub-Manager
An application for a class project to manage subscriptions, when they exipre, renew, and when you can cancel.

# Feature Ideas
* Users sign in and add subscriptions to their list.
* A way of tracking how much they are spending per a month, and year.
* Way to remove subscriptions, and modify them.
* Nice graphs to display the stats of total spent.

# Implementation
* An app in Java for android.
* A backend to handle signing in, adding, removing, updating, subscriptions. 
* A way to calculate and update costs as the subscriptions are renewed and re-billed.
* Push notifications from the back-end to the app when they need to be notified.

# Parts I worked on:
This was a group project that I did for a class, and the parts I worked on were the android frontend and helping with the backend to make sure they worked well together. The parts I wrote were the model, cache, and a few classes in the presenter and view. I did go through and verify work by others to make sure they were following the architecture and helped implement parts in the views and such as well as the server access points.

# who worked on the project:
Kurumi, Seungyoul, Kyungwoo, Ashtyn, Toren.
